      <h2>Growing Up</h2>
   
    <p>i used to play soccer when I was in Junior High School, my key position was number 11 on the left side on front 
      center position which is the position for 10. I was the star player in my team and I helped my team qualify for different 
      major tornament in my district, I got enjured and decided not to pursue soccer as a career when I went to High School.
      I also use to watch and play music a lot even though I do not have that much time like I did back in the days.
